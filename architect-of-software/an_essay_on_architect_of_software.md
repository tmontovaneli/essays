# An essay on architect of software

###### By Thiago Montovaneli

```
It was written after reading the books: The mythical man-month and Build Microservices by  Brooks F. and Newman S., respectively.

Even though it's an essay on architect of software, it does not aim to introduce the concept, describing all activities that usually are assigned to architects.

It only brings up a few thoughts after reading the books.

The mythical man-month (TMMM) book ended up being way better than I was supposing it would be. At the end of it, I could understand what it is about. And it's not about technical issues. It's about people.

This understanding changes the idea I used to have before and throughout the reading.

One can notice that Brooks and NewMan basically say the same thing about architect of software. They understand the role as a fundamental one in a system project. More important though is what they should be focusing on.

The authors state that architects should be working on making pieces of the system to communicate properly. That means to define an interface that exposes what is needed in order to integrate softwares.

Both also agree that little matter what is happening in each piece of the system from the architect perspective. And a good architect should be away from micro definition, unless he or she is required.

Brooks and Newman agree that important decisions, the ones that will affect the whole system, should be made by one or very few minds, in Brook's words: 

> ... the design must proceed from one mind, or from very small number of agreeing resonant minds 

Newman brings up the idea of Governance.

> ... governance is about ensuring what we are building matches the vision, and evolving the vision if needed. 

Newman affirms that governance usually is a group activity. 

According to Newman, the governance group will ensure the software is following the vision, and by doing so, they might end up making decisions as well. The architect might not agree with the decisions made by the group. And Newman says something interesting:

> The group is often much wiser than the individual.

This idea of having a group is not mentioned by Brooks, it might be a recent concept in the industry. And the author suggests an idea that is utterly contradictory to Newman's understanding.

As Brooks keeps the idea of few minds designing the software, a question of aristocracy arises. 

> Are not the architects a new aristrocacy, an intellectual elite, set up to tell the poor dumb implementers what to do?

His answer is yes and no. The yes answer comes from his understanding that in order to keep the conceptual integrity, the system design cannot have many minds making it up.

> If a system is to have conceptual integrity, someone must control the concepts. That is an aristocracy that needs no apology.

The no answers goes in the way that, even though the system design is set up, the developers will be able to make decisions about their job when the development time has come.

Both authors also agree when it comes to engaging the team to be as creative as possible. This is possible by encouraging ownership. In Newman's words:

> I am a strong believer that great software comes from great people

In Brooks':

> ... the quality of the team is by far the largest factor in success ...



### Conclusion

Being an architect demands many different skills, deep technical knowledge, persuasion, effective communication, negotiation etc. Certainly it is way harder than most people think it might be.

Whenever a decision is made by architects, software developers should put themselves in the architects' shoes, trying to understand why the decision was made like that. Understanding that architects usually are thinking way broader, because they know much more of the system holistically, will expand the developers way of thinking. Little by little, developers become architects. 

It's evident as well how people should be valued throughout a system project. No matter how hard people are sharing knowledge in a project, or documenting every single piece of it, losing someone will always be expensive. It's true that there are cases where too little can be done. But companies and managers should always be pushing hard on this matter, trying their best in order to keep the team gathered together.
