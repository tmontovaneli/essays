## Essays

1. [An essay on architect of software](https://github.com/tmontovaneli/essays/blob/main/architect-of-software/an_essay_on_architect_of_software.md)

   ```
   It was written after reading the books: The mythical man-month and Building Microservices by  Brooks F. and Newman S., respectively.
   
   Even though it's an essay on architect of software, it does not aim to introduce the concept, describing all activities that usually are assigned to architects.
   
   It only brings up a few thoughts after reading the books.
   ```
